# HeartStrokePrediction
According to WHO, stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. 
Here, I have applied different predictive models to predict the stroke based on different dataset features and compared their accuracy recall and f1 score for these models. The main goal is to reduce the false negative prediction of the model in turn reding the recall. I have compared the decision tree classifier, XGBoost classifier, KNN and Support vector machine. Support vector machine is providing the best result out of them. <br>
The data has been taken from the Kaggle website dataset.
