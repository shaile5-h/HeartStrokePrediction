# HeartStrokePrediction
According to WHO, stroke is second leading cause of death worldwide. 
Here, I have applied different predictive model to predict the stroke based on different features of the dataset and compared their accuracy recall and f1 score for these models. The main goal is to reduce the false negative prediction of the maodel in turn reding the recall. The data has been taken from kaggle website dataset. I have compared decision tree classifier, xgboost classifier, KNN and Support vector machine. Support vector machine is providing best result out of them.
